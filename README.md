Ad Victoriam brother!

The BOS watch is the second version of my GPS enabled wristwatches. Stripped of the non used features of the [Pipman](https://www.random-hackery.net/pipman-gps-watch/) , the BOS watch contains all of the fixes and new features a man travling the wastes could want

Features
---------------
- GPS time syncing - get local time anywhere on earth at power up

- Tilt compensated compass (with LED directional indicators and exact heading information)

- Stop watch / countdown timer

- Speaker

- TV B-gone

- Laser

- low power usage

Tech
---------
The BOS watch uses an arm processor (no more awful propeller spin code)
