Ad Victoriam brother!

The BOS watch is the second version of my GPS enabled wristwatches. Stripped of the non used features and annoyances of the [Pipman](https://www.random-hackery.net/pipman-gps-watch/) , the BOS watch contains all things a man travling the wastes could want ^1^

Features
---------------
- GPS time syncing - get local time anywhere on earth at power up

- Tilt compensated compass (with LED directional indicators and exact heading information)

- Stop watch / countdown timer

- Speaker (Plays the fallout theme!)

- TV B-gone

- A Frickn' Laser!&trade;

- Low power usage

- USB charging


-  Gieger Counter sound emulator (planned at least)

- Retro look and feel using custom DIP switches (with 7 operating modes) and 1970's era calculator display bubble LEDs

- The ability to repel women from 5 yards away!

Tech
---------
The BOS watch uses an arm processor and C (Huzzah! No more awful propeller spin code)
